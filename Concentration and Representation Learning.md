Polar Codes

We have some types of channel coding which control the content of information passing through the channel

The polar code is one of these channel coding which constructed by applying matrix multiplication on the input code through the source in which we can decode it step by step

By  increasing the number of bits in polar code we reach a level in which the content of information only goes through the special bit in the output of the channel maybe we can consider it as a type of representation in which, in high dimentional regime, we can see that the output information only send some pieces of information in very patant way. Therefore, we can use the idea of polar code in order to demystify the filtering of the information.



#### The question is that how to extent the idea beyond the binary codes to continous representation?
Maybe one approach is to convert each continious representation into the binary bits useing the the ideas of discretization and convering number and packing number.
