## Markov Chain and Learning
The idea is that each Learning process is about finding a distribution. On the other hand, each Markov Chain, under certain circumstances, can converge to a distribution. Therefore, one approach to a Learning problem is to create a pipline to control  and adjust a behavior of a Markov chain in order to converge to the desired distrbution.

Here MDP come to our attention
