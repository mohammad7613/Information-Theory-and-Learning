Basically Self-Supervised Idea is my tasks idea (the one I conjured up when I was learning about Denoising Task and how it is used to train EBMs).
To reiterate, the idea is that of creating tasks based on the available data and solving those tasks with models hoping that by overcoming the tasks, models are learning the hidden structure of data.
