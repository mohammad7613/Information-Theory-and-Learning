![[Representation Learning and MDP.svg]]



On the ground that we don't know what information is usefull for a down stream task, we can not directly set Objective Function in RL.    


One approach to handle it in the contex of MDP is to Learn Reward Function or Objective Function. In the contex of RL with MDP view of mind, learning the model of the environment is not the matter fact. Instead the Reward function lead us to the Optimal policy (Stochastic mapping or representation) in terms of keeping usefull information for a downstream task.
