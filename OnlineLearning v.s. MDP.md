In online learning, by and large, we don't have any assumption on distrbution of observations


In supervised Learning view in mind, in online learning we don't have test and train datasets and so there is no concepts of generalization error. Instead, we have the concept of regret. Mathmatically speacking, in online learning, we deal with a hypothesis set and we look for the best hypothesis labeling the observations.
